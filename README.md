# Applied Mechanics

This is a repository of all of the coding files from Engphys 2P04. This includes both Maple and FlexPDE files to simulate a variety of different scenarios.
 
The repository is organized with a folder for each week containing all of the program files for that week's problems, assignment, and test. The name of the folder will indicate the week as well as the topic.
